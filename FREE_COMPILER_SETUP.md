# 🎉 FREE Compiler Setup - No Configuration Needed!

## Great News!

Your website now has a **built-in compiler that works completely FREE** with **zero configuration**!

## How It Works

The compiler automatically uses **Piston API**, which is:
- ✅ **100% FREE** - No costs, no subscriptions
- ✅ **No API keys needed** - Works immediately
- ✅ **No rate limits** - Use as much as you want
- ✅ **Supports 20+ languages** - C++, Java, C#, Go, Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more

## Supported Languages (FREE)

- **C++** (cpp)
- **C** (c)
- **Java** (java)
- **C#** (csharp)
- **Go** (go)
- **Rust** (rust)
- **Python** (python)
- **JavaScript** (javascript)
- **TypeScript** (typescript)
- **PHP** (php)
- **Ruby** (ruby)
- **Swift** (swift)
- **Kotlin** (kotlin)
- **Scala** (scala)
- **Perl** (perl)
- **R** (r)
- **Bash** (bash)
- **SQL** (sql)

## Getting Started

**That's it!** No setup needed. Just:

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to any interview question page

3. Select a language (C++, Java, etc.)

4. Write your code

5. Click "Run Code"

6. See the results instantly! 🚀

## How It Works Behind the Scenes

The compiler uses **Piston API** (https://emkc.org/api/v2/piston/execute), which is a free, open-source code execution engine. Your code is executed securely in isolated containers.

## Browser-Based Languages

Some languages also work directly in the browser (no API calls):
- **SQL** - Uses sql.js (runs in browser)
- **Python** - Uses Pyodide (runs in browser)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Runs natively in browser

## Optional: Use Judge0 Instead

If you want to use Judge0 API instead (for features like execution time and memory usage), see `JUDGE0_SETUP.md` for configuration options. But **Piston API works great by default**!

## Troubleshooting

### Code not executing?
- Make sure you're connected to the internet (Piston API requires internet)
- Check browser console for any errors
- Try refreshing the page

### Language not supported?
- Check the list above for supported languages
- Some languages might have different names (e.g., "cpp" not "c++")

### Need help?
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Make sure your code syntax is correct
- For compilation errors, check the error message in the output

## That's It!

Enjoy your **FREE built-in compiler**! No setup, no costs, no limits. Just code and run! 🎉
